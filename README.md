Jiphy</a> is imagined to serve as a lightweight alternative to Giphy, (ironically) using Giphy API.

Built with my go-to technologies ( <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">`Vue`</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">`tailwindcss`</a> ), the goal of the project was to showcase that (somewhat) useful app can be built within hours of prototyping and experimenting using only default libraries from a CDN.
